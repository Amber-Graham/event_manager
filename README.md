# event_manager

This project is all about file input and output manipulation, reading CSV files and transforming them, and utilizing the data inside them.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

I loved this project! This was the first time I felt as though
I could immediately begin implementing this in my daily life. I am
almost kicking myself for not knowing how to do this before, as it would
have saved me hours and hours of data management time in my previous job!

I went ahead and separated the assignment section for days and times into
their own category in order to create another .erb template that I could
"send" to the boss. I thought that was more realistic than having to 
comment out certain sections of my code for the other assignment.

All in all, this has been my favorite Ruby project. It is so applicable 
and made so much sense to me. I learned about valuable methods like:
strftime; strptime; #hour; reinforced gsub and gsub!; and overall file
manipulation.

Happy coding! xx
